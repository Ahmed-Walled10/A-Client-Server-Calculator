# A-Client-Server-Calculator
# TCP Arithmetic Server üñ•Ô∏è‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó

A lightweight TCP server that handles basic arithmetic operations over network connections. Built with Python's `socket` library, this server listens for client requests, processes calculations, and returns results in real-time. Ideal for learning network programming fundamentals.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: 
  - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`)
- **Network-Ready**:
  - Listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) at port `54321`
  - Handles multiple sequential clients (one at a time)
- **Robust Error Handling**:
  - Invalid input formatting
  - Division by zero attempts
  - Unsupported operators
  - Connection drops
- **Clean Connection Management**:
  - Graceful shutdown with `over` command
  - Automatic socket cleanup

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Running the Server
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tcp-arithmetic-server.git
cd tcp-arithmetic-server

# Start the server
python3 server.py

# Expected output:
# Socket successfully created.
# Server bound to 0.0.0.0:54321
# Server is listening for incoming connections...
